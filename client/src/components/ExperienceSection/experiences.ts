    description:"My role as an AI Intern was centered on spearheading AI model development for cross-project defect predictions. I built an Abstract Syntax Tree-based code evaluation algorithm, essential for dataset formation. A pivotal part of my responsibilities involved meticulously gathering, extracting, and processing code from diverse GitHub issues to curate the dataset. I engineered a robust pipeline that seamlessly integrated the code evaluation algorithm with the defect prediction model. A highlight of my achievements was the implementation of a CNN-based Genetic Algorithm, boosting the model accuracy by an impressive 10%, culminating in an overall accuracy milestone of 90%. Additionally, I led and mentored a team of 6 interns, overseeing their progress through regular meetings, while also providing comprehensive guidance and hands-on training to ensure successful implementation of project sub-modules."
